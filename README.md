# CS231n 2019 Spring Assignment

## Assignment 1

Details about this assignment can be found [on the course webpage]

### Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (Complete)
The IPython Notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

### Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (Complete)
The IPython Notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

### Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (Complete)
The IPython Notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

### Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (Complete)
The IPython Notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

### Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (Complete)
The IPython Notebook features.ipynb will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

## Assignment 2

### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (20 points)
The IPython notebook FullyConnectedNets.ipynb will introduce you to our modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several popular update rules.

### Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)
In the IPython notebook BatchNormalization.ipynb you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

### Q3: Dropout (10 points)
The IPython notebook Dropout.ipynb will help you implement Dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

### Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
In the IPython Notebook ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

### Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)
For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks. You do NOT need to do both, and we will not be awarding extra credit to those who do.

Open up either PyTorch.ipynb or TensorFlow.ipynb. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

NOTE 1: The PyTorch notebook requires PyTorch version 1.0, which comes pre-installed on the Google cloud instances.

NOTE 2: The TensorFlow notebook requires Tensorflow version 2.0. If you want to work on the Tensorflow notebook with your VM from assignment1, please follow the instructions on Piazza to install TensorFlow. New virtual machines that are set up following the instructions will come with the correct version of Tensorflow.
